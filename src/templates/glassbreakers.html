                Glassbreakers is a community for women to build their professional network, and meet peer mentors with similar career goals. The company started as a consumer product, and now is expanding into enterprise.

                The product team at Glassbreakers is lead by Lauren Mosenthal, a developer and product leader who I met at BDW. Along with the growing team of full time designers and engineers, there is a small team of design and copywriting contractors who work on the product each week called "the forge". This contractor team meets on a weekly basis as needed. We work through problems with the product - white boarding, building, and designing.
