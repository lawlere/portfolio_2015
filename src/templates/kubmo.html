                      As a short-term contractor for Simple Habit, I worked on refining the meditation experience when the user gets to the website. We prioritized getting users into a meditation session as soon as possible, and focusing the user when inside of a meditation session.

                      I worked on a 3-month project with Sapling to redesign the frontend experience of their B2B product. They transitioned to an Angular frontend template, so we worked to build out templates and patterns in the new component-based frontend system. In 3 months, the design of the entire product was completed and implemented.

                      The team at Glassbreakers is lead by Lauren Mosenthal, a developer and product leader who I met at BDW. Along with the growing team of full time designers and engineers, there is a small team of design and copywriting contractors who work each week called "the forge". This contractor team meets on a weekly basis as needed. We work through problems with the product - white boarding, building, and designing.

                    In September and October of 2016, I was an Impact Advisor for the team coming from Kenya. They ended up winning the pitch event, and bringing funding back to Kenya to implement their impact project, called One Desk, One Child.

                    In spring of 2017, I was selected to go on a delegation trip to Kenya to see what the TechWomen alumni were working on. It was amazing to see how women in tech work in Nairobi, you can read my blog post about it.
