# Emma Lawler Portfolio 2015

## Installation

Install [nodejs and npm](http://nodejs.org/download/) (they come together), then [install grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

Then just run `make` in the root directory of this project to build and create a dev server

## Usage

To run the dev server, in the root of the directory run `make`. This will build all of the files and start a dev server at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

# Contributing

* Modify files in the `/src/` folder
* Only modify `.less` files - do not modify `.css` files directly.

## Deployment

Build the website with `make build`. The final website will be outputted in the `/build/` folder.
